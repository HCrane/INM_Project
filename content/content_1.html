	<h1> Platform Independence</h1>
    <hr />
  	<h4>What is the meaning of platform independence?</h4>
  		<p>Platform independent, cross-platform or multi-platform in computing means
  		   that you can run code with little or no modification on multiple platforms.</p>
  		<p>Platform Independent software can be divided into two types:</p>
  		<ul>
  		  <li>The first requires individual building or compilation for each platform that it supports</li>
  		  <li>The other one can be directly run on any platform without special preparation</li>
  		</ul>

	<h4>How is Java platform independent?</h4>
		<p>Java has a virtual machine the so-called JVM short for Java Virtual Machine.<br> <br>
			What happens in case of Java is that the JVM once installed on any platform
			like windows or OS X can run the java code without any alteration.<br>
			The JVM acts like a virtual platform on which the code is executed.<br>
			As the platform being JVM remains constant throughout all platforms Java programs
			can run on any platform irrespective of the real platform.</p>

		<p>Java source code is first converted to javabyte code.<br>
			This byte code is not readable by the original platform, but only the JVM can read it and then it executes it. <br> <br>
			JVMs are available for most well known Operating Systems like Windows, OS-X, Linux etc -
			so once you've developed your software in Java you can run it on any of these platforms.<br>
			This is the primary reason why Java is much in use even today.</p>

	<h4>Java Virtual Machine</h4>
		<p>The JVM itself needs specific versions for each platform to take account of different native instruction codes and machine capabilities (so you can't run a Windows JVM on Linux and vice Versa).</p>
