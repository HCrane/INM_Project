  <h2> What is Java? </h2>
    <p>Java is an object-orientated programming language. It is one of the most popular coding languages. In the past few years, Java was very often on the first or second place in the ranking of the most popular programming languages. Java is a registered label of Sun Microsystems (belongs to Oracle since 2010). Java was first released in 1995.<br> <br> The biggest advantage of Java is its platform independence, which allows it to run on a huge range of devices. Typically Java doesn't run directly on hardware. There is a virtual machine, which processes the code. So mostly Java doesn't run directly on the hardware but trough software on the target platform. It allows developers to create applets and applications. Java is also being used in cars and many electronic devices. <br> <br>
    Java has a similar syntax to C and C++, but compared to other programming languages, Java is easy to learn and use. <br> <br>
